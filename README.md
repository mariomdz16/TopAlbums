# TopAlbums
This project is an iPhone application that will display the current top 100 albums accross all genres from iTunes. To view details on the album simply tap a cell row. If you would like to purchase the album or just see it in the iTunes store tap "See in iTunes" button.

*Note: Launchscreen was left in storyboard format only because all production apps will need to follow this in a few weeks.*
