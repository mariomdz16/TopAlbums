# TopAlbums
This project is an iOS application that will display the top 100 albums from all genres from an iTunes API. To view details on the album simply tap a cell row. If you would like to purchase the album or just see it in the iTunes store tap "See in iTunres" button.

*Note: Launchscreen was left in storyboard format only because all production apps will need to follow this in a few weeks.*
